<h2>About Us</h2>
<h3>The UP Connect Project</h3>
<p>The “UP Connect” seeks to establish an integrated academic community within the University of Porto, encouraging an environment where students can easily share knowledge through our platform.</p>
<p>The main goal of the project is the development of a web-based application that focuses on giving the students from University of Porto a way to share questions, knowledge and resources in an efficient and organized manner.</p>
<p>This project is being developed by a small team of Computer Engineering students at FEUP, in the scope of the LBAW curricular unit.</p>
